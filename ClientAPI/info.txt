Ok, let me introduce my code.

It`s test simple REST API Client for two process: get all producers and create new producer.

Client have two level.

 Basic level, where We have:
  - main objects(abstract classes),
  - commands(interfaces for basic elements),
  - operations(basic classes, what We can build more in future).

 Working level, whe We can build a lot requests for Producers and other API elements.


For main elements in ClientAPI, I use object Creds (abstract class Creds.php), when We can add static information
    or very interesting elements for TURN-OFF sending requests
    or We can check on PROD ENVIRONMENT(for example) and We must to call request methods with providing not testing login and password

I use autoloading of composer.



For testing my code I add file "php.php".
Please change test-producer info in file "Creds.php" in variable "TEST_PRODUCER"
and active the command in command line

$ php php.php

and You will take information about all producer and create new producer( like as write in "Creds.php")


in future must to write validation processing, DB models and more else things for this API Client...

Thank You for You spending time! And have a nice day!
